AWAZ

Problem statement :
While typing on your Laptop if u need to send something to your phone 
what do u do ?
Send an email to your phone?
Send it on viber desktop open it on viber mobile app ?
RETYPE??
Wouldn’t it be easy if I could just live type my text to my mobile ?
Sounds like a problem we want to solve 
Not just this, we want to use sound from a washing machine to tell us what’s wrong with it (powered by chat bot )
We have different devices with multiple operating systems but most of them have a Speaker and Mic, data sharing in close proximity can be done over sound . 
Imagine you meet someone at the hotel and you need to share contact details , Don’t waste a business card ….AWAZ is all you need  

 
Brief :
local data encoding and decoding for device-to-device communication without server connectivity .
we share data to devices with sound ,imagine not having to scan a QR code! EVER .
Type between your desktop and mobile with the same keyboard !
 
 





Share contact with any 1 close to you over sound ☺ 
 
 
 
Avoid ticket counters 
 
 








your washing machine just stopped 
just share the error codes over sound to the chat bot and get a fix instantly with our bot telling you what’s exactly wrong just order the part from Rakuten.com  
  

 keyless entry with smart sound keys !
 
  
 We would love to hear from you , waiting for your AWAZ  

Thanks,
TEAM AWAZ 
 
 
 
 
Everything from bird chirps to human language can be considered a form of data-over-sound. It’s old hat for computers too: the squeal of a dial-up modem is actually digital data encoded into sound and then interpreted by another computer.

Unlike dial-up modems, this new wave of data-over-sound technologies transmits messages over the air, instead of over wires, even if you can't always hear the audio frequencies they use.
Here’s how it works: One device translates a chunk of data, such as a block of text, into a sequence of sounds that can be decoded by another device. The receiving device processes the audio and converts it back to the original form.
Even using compression, sound waves can only carry a limited amount of data compared to a Wi-Fi connection. So today developers use the technology primarily to transmit small files, such as a digital ticket

Mick Grierson, a professor of computing at Goldsmiths, University of London, says that, done properly, audio could actually be a good way to send secure communications, because in many cases no one else will know that a message is being sent. He's worked on projects where data is hidden in another sound. In fact, Grierson imagines future applications for data-over-sound in emergency and military communications.


Abstract:
In this paper, we proposed data communication method based on inaudible sound which the most people cannot listen to at near field. The proposed method can transmit some bits data as using mixed high frequencies which are mapped at each data bit. Besides, the proposed method increases the accuracy of data transmission as using cyclic redundancy check for prevention of transmission error. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we tested with the proposed method and the result showed 97.5% accuracy. Therefore, the proposed method could be applied at various wireless data communication technology fields.
