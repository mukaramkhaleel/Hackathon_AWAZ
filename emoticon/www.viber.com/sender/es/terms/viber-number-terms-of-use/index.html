		</header>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>These Terms of Use apply to the agreement between Viber Media S.a.r.l (“Viber”) and you, as a subscriber to the Viber Local Number Service (as defined at the end of this document).  By using the Viber Lcoal Number Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use and any new versions of this document. These Terms of Use are accepted by you (a) when you click to accept or agree to the terms; or (b) when you use the Viber Local Number Service.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #665cac;">1. Updates to Terms.</span></strong></p>
<p>We may revise and reissue these Terms of Use occasionally, by posting updated Terms of Use, due to updates to our services or to applicable laws. You consent and agree to receive notices of updates of these Terms of Use through our posting of updated Terms of Use on the Website. You should visit the Website regularly to review the current Terms of Use. If you do not agree to the updated Terms of Use, you should stop using the Viber Local Number Service and/or close your Account. Your continued use of the Viber Local Number Service will be deemed as your acceptance of any revisions.</p>
<p><span style="color: #665cac;"><strong>2. Viber Local Number Subscription Service Features and Terms.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>2.1</strong> The Viber Local Number Service allows you to subscribe to the use of a Viber Local Number with an area code from the territories listed within the Viber application.  While you may purchase the Viber Local Number through Viber’s application, Viber’s third party number suppliers and their respective service providers (a list of which can be found <strong><a href="https://www.viber.com/app/uploads/Service-Providers-for-Viber-Number-Service.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></strong>) (collectively, “<strong>Administrators</strong>”) are the provider(s) and/or owner(s) of the phone number.  You agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Administrators, which are incorporated herein by reference. In addition, these Administrators may collect and process certain data according to their privacy policy, in order to perform the service.  Links to such terms and conditions and privacy policies of the Administrators may be found <strong><a href="https://www.viber.com/app/uploads/Service-Providers-for-Viber-Number-Service.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a></strong>].</p>
<p><strong>2.2</strong> You agree that you do not own the Viber Local Number or have any right to retain the Viber Local Number forever.  The Viber Local Number will be allocated to you, provided that the Administrators determine that the number is available and legally permissible. If you are eligible for a phone number, it will be allocated to you as soon as reasonably possible after the Administrators have received your request.  Neither Viber nor the Administrators guarantee that a requested phone number can be allocated to you or that you can make use of the Viber Local Number feature. The allocation of a phone number to you does not constitute any transfer of title, ownership, license or other rights with regard to the phone number. If you terminate your subscription to the Viber Local Number Service, there is no guarantee that the phone number allocated to you prior to your termination of your subscription will be available for use.  Neither Viber nor the Administrators will be liable for any damages resulting from a phone number change. The Administrators may, without any liability to Viber and/or the Administrators, refuse, de-allocate or terminate any phone number at any time. If Viber and/or the Administrators de-allocate or terminate the phone number that has been allocated to you for any reason, you will not be entitled to a refund from Viber or the Administrators. You must review the terms of purchase between you and the online store from which you purchased a subscription to the Viber Local Number Service in order to determine whether you are entitled to any refund from them.</p>
<p><strong>2.3</strong> Viber and/or the Administrators reserve the right to reclaim any phone number from your Account if you do not send sufficient traffic over that phone number such that the phone number is unutilized or underutilized, as defined by any local, federal, and/or national regulatory agency and/or governmental organization with oversight over the relevant phone number and numbering plan. If Viber and/or the Administrators seek to reclaim a phone number from your Account due to your phone number being unutilized or underutilized, excluding suspended and trial accounts, we will send you an email at least one (1) week in advance telling you that such phone number is being reclaimed, unless we’re otherwise prevented from doing so by the applicable regulatory agency or governmental organization. We also reserve the right to reclaim phone numbers from Viber accounts suspended or blocked for failure to pay and/or suspended for suspected fraud or breach of law, or a suspected violation of Viber’s Fair Usage Policy or any other reason listed in the Viber terms of use.</p>
<p><strong>2.4 </strong>While you may use Viber Local Number for incoming and outgoing calls, you may not forward, transfer or port away your phone number to any other service provider or any other third party.</p>
<p><strong>2.5 </strong>You may not use the Viber Local Number and/or the Viber Local Number Service for any identity verification purposes.</p>
<p><strong>2.6 </strong>The use of the Viber Local Number Service is subject to the <a href="../viber-terms-use/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viber Terms of Use</a>, the <a href="https://www.viber.com/es/terms/viber-out-calls-fair-usage-principles#vln-fair-use-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viber Local Number Fair Usage Principles</a>, the <a href="../viber-privacy-policy/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viber Privacy Policy</a>, the <a href="../viber-payments-policy/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viber Payments Policy</a>, and the <a href="../cookies-and-tracking/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viber Cookies &amp; Tracking Technologies Policy</a>, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. To the extent any of the terms in any of the foregoing terms of use and/or policies conflict with the terms of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall govern and prevail.</p>
<p><strong>2.7 </strong>The Viber Local Number Service is intended for individual use only.  We may terminate your subscription and/or block your access to and/or usage of the Viber Local Number Service if we notice that your usage is in breach of our Viber Local Number Fair Usage Principles.  We reserve the right to change the Viber Local Number Service subscription plan or stop offering it at any time. In the event the Viber Local Number Service includes a bundle of features, we will notify you in the event that the types of products included in the subscription service change and you will have the right to terminate the subscription.</p>
<p><strong>2.8 </strong>You understand that the caller ID for persons calling your VLN number may not reflect the original phone number of the caller.</p>

<p><strong>9.1 </strong>The Viber Local Number Service is provided under Viber’s license according to the terms of this Agreement. Viber will try to provide the Viber Local Number Service with minimum disruptions. However, neither Viber nor the Administrators guarantee that the Viber Local Number Service will always function without disruptions, delay or other imperfections. Since the Viber Local Number Service will be transmitted through public Internet lines and the public switched telephone network (“PSTN”), there may be power outages or Internet service disruption and you may experience some disruptions, e.g., packet loss and delay which will interfere with the quality of your communication. Additionally, you also understand that calls to or from the PSTN are not encrypted and as such, could be potentially subject to interception by law enforcement officials or other such monitoring by other legally authorized third parties. Neither Viber nor the Administrators shall be liable for any disruption, delays, monitoring, eavesdropping or other omissions in the Viber Local Number Service.</p>
<p><strong>9.2 </strong>WITHOUT LIMITING VIBER’S EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE TERMS, VIBER HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND WARRANTIES RELATED TO THIRD-PARTY EQUIPMENT, MATERIAL, SERVICES OR SOFTWARE. EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE VIBER LOCAL NUMBER SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. TO THE EXTENT THIS DISCLAIMER CONFLICTS WITH APPLICABLE LAW, THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF ANY APPLICABLE WARRANTY WILL BE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED UNDER THAT LAW.</p>
<p><strong>10. <span style="color: #665cac;">Indemnification.</span></strong> You will defend, indemnify and hold Viber and its Affiliates harmless against any actual or threatened claim, loss, liability, proceeding, third-party discovery demand, governmental investigation or enforcement action arising out of or relating to your activities under this Agreement, including, without limitation, any violation by you of this Agreement (“Claim”). You will pay all costs, reasonable attorneys’ fees and any settlement amounts or damages awarded against us in connection with any Claim. You will also be liable to us for any costs and attorneys’ fees we incur to successfully establish or enforce our right to indemnification under this Section.</p>
<p><strong>11. <span style="color: #665cac;">Exclusion of Damages; Limitations on Liability.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>11.1 </strong>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, WILL VIBER BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOST PROFITS, LOST SALES OR BUSINESS, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, LOST DATA, OR FOR ANY AND ALL OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF WE HAD BEEN ADVISED, KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

<p><strong>11.4 </strong>AS SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS AS ESTABLISHED HEREIN, SOME OF THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  IN SUCH EVENT THE LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED AS FAR AS LEGALLY POSSIBLE UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAWS.</p>
<p><strong>12. <span style="color: #665cac;">Force Majeure.  </span></strong>You acknowledge and understand that the Viber Local Number Service may not function, and Viber will not be in breach of any of its obligations towards you under this Agreement, in the event of a force majeure event. A force majeure event means any event beyond the control of Viber.  In the event Viber is affected by a force majeure event, it shall promptly notify you of the estimated extent and duration of its inability to perform or delay in performing its obligations, on a reasonable efforts basis.

<p><strong>13.3 <span style="color: #665cac;">No Waiver.</span></strong> The failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, a right, power or remedy provided by the terms of this Agreement or by law shall not constitute a waiver of that right, power or remedy. If Viber waives a breach of any provision of this Agreement, this shall not operate as a waiver of a subsequent breach of that provision, or as a waiver of a breach of any other provision.</p>
<p><strong>13.4 <span style="color: #665cac;">No Assignment by You.</span></strong> You are not allowed to assign this Agreement or any rights hereunder.</p>
