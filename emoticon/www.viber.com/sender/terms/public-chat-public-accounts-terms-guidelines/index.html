		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The Public Account, Public Chat, Bot, Community and the Viber Admin Panel (VAP) services, as defined herein and referred to collectively as the “<strong>Services</strong>”,<strong> </strong>are offered to you as part of the other services provided through, or in connection with, the Viber application (“<strong>Viber App</strong>”) and are another way of spreading good vibes. If you choose to use these Services, please take a few minutes to read our <a href="http://www.viber.com/en/eula"><strong>Terms of Use</strong></a>, Viber’s <a href="../viber-privacy-policy/index.html"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></a>, Viber’s <a href="../viber-public-content-policy/index.html"><strong>Public Content Policy</strong></a> and Viber’s <a href="../dmca/index.html"><strong>DMCA Policy</strong></a> (collectively, the “<strong>Viber Policies</strong>”) as well as the below Viber Public Account, Public Chat, Bot, Community and VAP Terms &amp; Guidelines (the “<strong>Guidelines</strong>”) which govern your use of the Services.</p>
<p>You must be at least 13 years old to use all Viber Services. References to <strong>“Administrator”</strong> refer collectively to Public Account Administrators, Public Chat Administrators, Bot Administrators, Community Administrators (including Superadmins) and VAP Administrators. The Viber Policies and these Guidelines apply to all uses of the Services as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>THE SERVICES</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>1.1 As a user of the Services, you will be exposed to content shared by other users of the Services (“<strong>Viber Users</strong>”). The Services may contain content from Viber Users on a variety of topics and all Viber Users must adhere to the <a href="../viber-public-content-policy/index.html"><strong>Content Policy</strong></a>, the <a href="http://www.viber.com/en/eula"><strong>Terms of Use</strong></a> and these Guidelines. Viber does not control nor take any responsibility for the content posted by Viber Users on any Service. Nonetheless, if you feel that the content which has been posted, shared or engaged violates our <a href="../viber-public-content-policy/index.html"><strong>Content Policy</strong></a>, please report such content through <a href="https://support.viber.com/"><strong>Viber support</strong></a> and we will review and address the matter further. You can “unfollow” from a certain Public Chat and Public Account at any time by clicking the “unfollow” button, “unsubscribe” from a Public Chat, a Public Account or Bot Service at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” button or from a Community by clicking &#8220;leave and delete&#8221;. In addition, if you believe the content in any particular Service infringes your copyrights, you may request removal of such content (or access thereto) by contacting our designated copyright agent. Please go to the <a href="../dmca/index.html"><strong>DMCA notification page</strong></a> to review our DMCA notification guidelines and procedures.</p>
<p>1.2 You will only use the Services for lawful purposes. In this respect, you may not, without limitation: (a) intercept or monitor, damage or modify any communication which is not intended for you; (b) use any type of spider, virus, worm, defects, trojan-horse, time bomb or any other malicious or infringing codes or instructions that are designed to distort, delete, damage or disassemble the Services, Viber App or the Viber API or underlying software or any communication; (c) use of the Services, Viber App or the Viber API in such a manner that disrupts, or interferes with, the normal and proper functioning and operation of Viber’s servers, systems and networks or that creates a security risk or threat to Viber, the Viber App or the Viber Users or that fails to comply with Viber’s documentation or other technical instructions relating to the Viber API; (d) send any unsolicited communication (“<strong>SPAM</strong>”) not permitted by applicable law or promote bulk marketing products, the purpose of which is to send SPAM, including bulk messaging, bulk email software, lists of email without opt-in of the Viber User; (e) use the Services to promote false, misleading, dishonest, inaccurate, unrealistic or deceptive products or services or to otherwise mislead Viber Users; (f) expose any third party to material which is offensive, harmful to minors, indecent or otherwise objectionable in any way or use the Services to cause or intend to cause embarrassment or distress to, or to threaten, harass or invade the privacy of, any third party; (g) use any material or content that is subject to any third party proprietary rights, unless you have a license or permission from the owner of such rights; (h) use the Services in any way directed to minors under the age of thirteen (13); (i) omit or fail to disclose any information that may be applicable to a Guest, Follower, Subscriber or Member (as defined below) or your Public Account, Bot or Community (as defined below) and ensure that you make all relevant disclosures; (j) use the Services to assist or enable direct conversations between Viber Users and healthcare providers or to send or collect any patient data or health-related data obtained from healthcare providers (k) use the Services in any manner which is considered by Viber as non-fair usage, including without limitation any use which is abnormal or unusual or takes an unreasonable advantage of the ability to open Public Accounts freely;</p>
<p>1.3 When you publish content or information using the Services, it means that you are allowing all Viber Users to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e. your name and profile picture, and, if you activate your location button on the chat screen, your location if you choose to attach it to your messages).</p>
<p>1.4 When you choose to use our Services, you agree and opt-in to receive from Viber and/or Administrator notifications related to the Public Account, Public Chat, Bot and/or Communities that you choose to follow, subscribe, patriciate in, join and/or administer.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>GUESTS, FOLLOWERS OR SUBSCRIBERS</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>2.1<strong> PUBLIC ACCOUNT. </strong>The Public Accounts feature enables you to view as guests, follow or subscribe to Public Accounts, which includes the Public Chat feature (each, a “<strong>Public Account</strong>”). When you visit a Public Account without Following it or Subscribing to it, you will be a “<strong>Guest</strong>” of a Public Account. As a Guest, if you click the “follow” button, you become a Follower of the Public Account and automatically a Subscriber of the Public Account as well. As a “<strong>Follower</strong>” of a Public Account, you may receive notices of updates to the content available in the Public Account and in the Public Chat included within the Public Account. As a “<strong>Subscriber”</strong> of a Public Account, you will be able to send and receive one-on-one messages with the Public Account. When you send a message to a Public Account you will automatically become a Subscriber of the Public Account with all that it entails. At any time, you can “unfollow” or “unsubscribe” or both “unfollow” and “unsubscribe” from any Public Account by clicking the “unfollow” and/or “unsubscribe” button.</p>
<p>2.2<strong> PUBLIC CHAT.</strong> Public Chat, is a chat feature within the Public Account feature which enables Viber Users to share content, engage in conversations and create chats that are available to the general public between other Viber Users who may have a common interest or affiliation (each a “<strong>Public Chat</strong>”). the Public Chat feature provides the ability to digitally follow particular Public Chat and watch all content and other information introduced in it.</p>
<p>2.3 <strong>BOT. </strong>The Viber Bot feature enables you to subscribe to third parties’ Bot(s) and to send and receive one-on-one messages from the Bot(s) (the “<strong>Bot</strong>”). When you visit a Bot without subscribing to it, you will be a “<strong>Guest</strong>” of the Bot. As a Guest, if you click the “<strong>subscribe</strong>” button or any button presented to you by the Bot, or write a one-on-one message to the Bot, you will automatically become a “<strong>subscriber</strong>” of the Bot and be able to send and receive messages from the Bot. At any time, you can unsubscribe from any Bot by clicking the “<strong>unsubscribe</strong>” button.</p>
<p>2.4 <strong>COMMUNITY</strong>. Communities are group chats through which Viber Users can exchange messages and engage with one another and can include up to 1 billion Viber Users (a “<strong>Community</strong>”). If you join you will become a “<strong>Member</strong>” of such Community. As a part of a Community, Viber Users can share content, engage in conversations, and share the Community with other Viber Users. Viber Users can leave a Community at any time by selecting the &#8220;<strong>Leave and delete</strong>&#8221; button. All Members of the Community can see the username and the photo of all the other Members of the Community.</p>
<p>Please be aware that the content of the conversations exchanged between Viber Users and Administrators through the Community, Public Account feature or the Bot feature, are not end-to-end encrypted and may be stored by Viber as well as the relevant Administrator(s) and their third party providers.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>VIBER ADMIN PANEL</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>In order to create a Public Account (which includes the Public Chat feature) and/or a Bot, you will need to do so via a designated website that integrates with the Viber App called the <strong>Viber Admin Panel </strong>or “<strong>VAP</strong>”. The VAP allows you to create Public Accounts and Bots, and to receive analytics of all your Public Accounts and Bots in a way that will enable you to monitor and track the activity of each Public Account and Bot that you manage, subject to the Viber Policies and these Guidelines (the “<strong>Analytics</strong>”). In the event that a Public Account has several Administrators, each Administrator will be able to see the information that the VAP provides on such account including analytics. Viber makes no warranties, representations or guarantees as to the accuracy and/or completeness of the Analytics provided via the VAP.</p>
<p>In order to open a Public Account or a Bot, you will need to provide the information requested by us to open your account, which may include, for example, a name and picture for your Public Account or Bot, categorize and subcategorize your Public Account or Bot and provide general information for these features. All of this information is subject to our <a href="../viber-privacy-policy/index.html"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></a> and, once published, will be visible to all Viber Users as an information screen (the “<strong>Info Screen</strong>”). The creation and publication of all Public Accounts will subject to Viber’s approval, in its sole discretion. The information you provide must be accurate.</p>
<p>Subject to these Guidelines and the Viber Policies, Viber grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license to copy and use the Analytics relating to the Public Account and/or Bot that you administer, solely for the purpose of monitoring the activity of your Public Account and/or Bot; Viber shall not be liable to any inaccuracies in any content and/or reports.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>ADMINISTRATORS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>4.1 <strong>PUBLIC ACCOUNT ADMINISTRATORS</strong>. If your Public Account is approved by Viber (via the VAP), you will open the Public Account and automatically become a Public Account Administrator (“<strong>Public Account Administrator</strong>”). As a Public Account Administrator, you have the option to either publish your Public Account or keep your Public Account unpublished. You can at any time elect to un-publish your Public Account. If you chose to publish your Public Account, and received approval from Viber to publish it, then it will be open and available for all Viber Users to search for, see, follow and subscribe to. However, even if your Public Account is unpublished, you may still direct Viber Users to your Public Account. As Public Account Administrator you have the right and ability to add or remove other Public Account Administrators. All Public Account Administrators will be subject to these Guidelines and Viber Policies, and to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. You acknowledge and agree that Viber reserves the right not to approve your Public Account and/or not to publish it, or stop its publication, at any time, in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>4.2<strong> PUBLIC CHAT ADMINISTRATORS. </strong>Once your Public Account was created and approved by Viber, it will automatically include a Public Chat which will be incorporated within the Public Account feature, and you will automatically become the administrator of such Public Chat (“<strong>Public Chat Administrator</strong>”). The Public Chat includes between 2-100 other Viber Users or “<strong>Participants</strong>” who can participate in such Public Chat, and As a Public Chat Administrator, you will have the right and ability to add or remove Participants of the Public Chat you have initiated, as well as delete content posted by any of the Participants. Participants can only remove the content that they posted. There can be more than one Public Chat Administrator for each Public Chat. Participants in a Public Chat shall be added by the Public Chat Administrator only subject to their full consent to these Guidelines and Viber Policies, and to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. As Public Chat Administrator you have the right and ability to add or remove other Public Chat Administrators. All Public Chat Administrators will be subject to these Guidelines and Viber Policies, and to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. A Public Chat Administrator may only open and administer one Public Chat within its Public Account under the terms above.</p>
<p>4.3 <strong>BOT ADMINISTRATORS</strong>. If your Bot is approved by Viber (Via the VAP), you will open the Bot and automatically become a Bot Administrator (“<strong>Bot Administrator</strong>”). The creation and maintenance of the Bot shall be subject to the <a href="https://www.viber.com/en/viber-developer-distribution-agreement"><strong>Viber Developer Distribution Agreement</strong></a>, as amended from time to time. As a Bot Administrator, you have the option to either publish your Bot or keep your Bot unpublished. You can at any time elect to un-publish your Bot. If you chose to publish your Bot and received approval from Viber to publish it, then it will be open and available for all Viber Users to search for, see and subscribe to. However, even if your Viber is unpublished, you may still direct Viber Users to your Bot. As a Bot Administrator, you will have the right and ability to add or remove other Bot Administrators. There can be more than one Bot Administrator for each Bot. Bot Administrators will be subject to these Guidelines and Viber Policies, and to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. You acknowledge and agree that Viber reserves the right not to approve your Bot and/or not to publish it, or stop its publication, at any time, in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>4.4 <strong>COMMUNITY ADMINISTRATORS</strong>. The option to create a Community is open to all Viber Users. Upon creating a Community, you will automatically become a “<strong>Superadmin</strong>” of your Community.  As a Superadmin you can add or remove other Superadmins, other Community Administrators and/or Members from the Community, control who can post in the Community, choose whether the Community can be shared by other Members or not, and delete messages by other Members. Superadmins can also revoke invite links and enlist other Viber Users to the Community to become Superadmins or<strong> “Community Administrators”</strong>. As a Community Administrator you can remove Members from the Community, delete messages posted by Members of the Community and send an invite to other Viber Users to become Members of the Community. There can be multiple Superadmins and Community Administrators to a Community, with a total limitation of 250 combined. Other Superadmins and/or Community Administrators can be added only subject to their full consent to these Guidelines and Viber Policies, and to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. You acknowledge and agree that Viber reserves the right not to approve your Community and/or not to publish it, or stop its publication, at any time, in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>4.5 <strong>Integrating Your Public Account and Bot with Third Party Platforms</strong>. As a Public Account Administrator and Bot Administrator, you may also automate your Public Account (including the Public Chat feature) and Bot messages and conversations with your Subscribers or integrate them with third party platforms via Viber’s Application Programming Interface (“<strong>Viber API</strong>”) and you are responsible for ensuring such third party agrees to the <a href="https://www.viber.com/en/viber-developer-distribution-agreement"><strong>Viber Developer Distribution Agreement</strong></a> and these Guidelines. If you do so, you are liable towards Viber and Viber Users for such third party’s acts in connection with any access you provide to your Public Account and Bot and your conversations, including without limitation, for any breach of Viber Users’ privacy and security of information, any breach of the Viber Policies or any breach of laws and regulations, even once you have closed such Public Account and/or Bot. Therefore, you should only use third parties that you trust and which are obligated to comply with these Guidelines and the <a href="https://www.viber.com/en/viber-developer-distribution-agreement"><strong>Viber Developer Distribution Agreement</strong></a>.</p>
<p>4.6 <strong>Automatic Subscription to Viber Public Account and Bot</strong>.

Of course, you may always elect to unfollow and unsubscribe from such Public Accounts, and unsubscribe from Bots, at any time.</p>
